# Pacman

# Description: 
The purpose of this exercise was to be able to control how pacman moved. He was created with two images; one image his mouth is open and the other with his mouth closed. He automatically moves to the right and once he hits the end of the page, he stops. I wanted to make him turn around and return to the other side of the page as soon as he hit the end of the page.

# Executing 
1st. I checked the coordinate for when the front of his face hits the end of the page so that I can add the width of the image (200 - provided in the code provided by MIT Pro) to that coordinate.
2nd. There is a if else statement providing controlling
